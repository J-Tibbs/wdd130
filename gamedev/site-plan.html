      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This website can help out with that. It will show those who want to make games how to start out in a game creator system called Unity. It will apply for both 2d and 3d games, so you’ll have a good start on making your next game.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is for those who want to make games, but don't know where or how to start.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page would be a brief summary of what’s going to be talked about. It would go over the pros and cons of different game engines as well as what we would be using for the tutorials. I feel people would come to this website to learn how to start making games. It will provide a basic guide to how to start different types of games.  Other sites have made tutorials, but this would be just a starter guide to show how to use some aspects of Unity, which is a game creating engine. It would also be targeted towards those who are just starting while still having some tricks in Unity to make the game making process easier. This front page would just answer questions on which engine to use as well as a quick rundown of some of the needed materials for the tutorials. Not too much prior information would be required. Only knowledge of how to create textures for objects, but that can be as simple as drawing a picture. The only needed programs would be Unity, VS code, and some paint program. The tutorials would be very simple and clear so it allows for beginners to start making games, no matter the skill level they’re at.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        The first page would be all about 2D game making. It would talk all about how to start by going over how to start 2D games with the basics of both a platformer game as well as for a bird’s eye view game. It would start off with adding the character and the basic area around the character. After that, it would go into basic movement of the character. It would include pictures of both the Unity window as well as the code I’m adding. The code would be explained with how it works according to my knowledge of it. I would try to make the tutorial as basic as possible in order for anyone to be able to use it. With the 2D platforming game, it would be shown how to add simple obstacles as well as some enemies with it. The bird’s eye view would be focused on making some of the aspects look more realistic for the game. This would include things of perspective and how to make the character able to go behind objects, which sounds easy but can be challenging for a beginner.  By the end of the tutorials, the reader will have a good start on making a 2D game of their choosing.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        The second page would be all about making a 3D game. This would only focus on a 3D platforming game rather than having variety. This will guide the reader through how to make a character, add movement to it, give a basic texture to the character as well as the surrounding area.  It will guide the reader through first person and a third person game.  This will guide them through using the asset store as well, seeing as how a model would be required. The guide would go over animations and movement for the game. The guide would go over creating a ground to walk on as well as basic obstacles to jump on. Since I am not as experienced with 3D game development, I may reference other guides. If I did do this, I would link the guides within the site. Within this page and the 2D game page, I would link other guides that may be able to give further information for how to add more to the game. At the end of this page, the reader could have created a start for a 3D game.
