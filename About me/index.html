        I'm going into computer science in hopes of going into game design. I created a basic video game back in high school for a school project. I love to play tennis and pickleball, as well as playing board games and video games.

        I currently do not have a job, but am planning on getting one at some point this semester.
        So far, I'm enjoying BYU-I and having a lot of fun with my friends.

        From learning web design, I can see myself being able to help create websites for companies I'm a part of if I may need to.

        I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since I was born 18 years ago. One of my favorite hymns is Let Us All Press On.
